# Search Algorithms Advanced

## Tasks

### 0. Interpolation search

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Interpolation search algorithm

* Prototype : int interpolation_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the first index where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
* To determine the probe position, you can use : size_t pos = low + (((double)(high - low) / (array[high] - array[low])) * (value - array[low]))
* Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

```
$ cat 102-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {
        0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, interpolation_search(array, size, 3));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 7, interpolation_search(array, size, 7));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, interpolation_search(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 102-main.c 102-interpolation.c -o 102-interpolation
$ ./102-interpolation 
Value checked array[6] = [2]
Value checked array[7] = [3]
Found 3 at index: 7

Value checked array[14] = [7]
Found 7 at index: 14

Value checked array[2109] is out of range
Found 999 at index: -1
```

### 1. Exponential search

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Exponential search algorithm

* Prototype : int exponential_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the first index where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
* You have to use powers of 2 as exponential ranges to search in your array
* Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching for, you have to print this value (See example)
* Once you’ve found the good range, you need to use a binary search:
* Every time you split the array, you have to print the new array (or subarray) you’re searching in (See example)

```
$ cat 103-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */

        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 18, 19, 23, 54, 61, 62, 76, 99
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 62, exponential_search(array, size, 62));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, exponential_search(array, size, 3));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, exponential_search(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
